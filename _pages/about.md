Hi everyone. I¡¯m currently a PhD student at Data & Knowledge Research Group, School of Computer Science, Nanjing University of Informtaion Science & Technologhy (NUIST) NUIST, starting at September 2022. I feel very much fortunate to be advised by Prof. Tinghuai Ma and Huan Rong. My research interests include Spatial-Temporal Data Mining, Graph Neural Networks, Knowledge Graph, Augmented Intelligence and AI+Meteorological. In general, I¡¯m always highly interested in the machine-learning foundation theory and AI+X technologies.
